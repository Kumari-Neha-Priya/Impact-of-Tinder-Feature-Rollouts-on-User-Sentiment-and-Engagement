/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

However, for someone who understands computers, this app's algorithm is very clear. Let me explain. You use the app (no subscription) and you’ll get a few likes. So you start swiping right searching for who liked you. You swipe right on just about everyone and still don’t find who liked you. So you decide to buy gold so you can see who liked you (you bought gold). You then match with one or two of the people who liked you (get ghosted or unmatched). You also notice that ever since you bought gold, you haven’t gotten any more likes. Gold expires and you repeat the exact same process. This is only the case for male users. The fact that Tinder would use this to prey on lonely men is both sickening and tells me their developers aren’t very intelligent (low IQ people are less empathetic). With that being said, if you’re a male, this app isn’t worth spending money on.",

I created an account last week, but despite being active for days and boosting my profile multiple times, I received zero likes—it was as if my account wasn’t visible. Support insisted everything was fine and refused to investigate further. To test whether there was an issue with my account, I created a new account with a different email and phone number. Within minutes, I got multiple likes, proving there was indeed an issue with my first account. Since the first account clearly wasn’t working, I tried to delete it, but was unable to do so. On the web, clicking "Delete My Account" made the pop-up disappear without actually deleting anything. In the app, I got an error: "Couldn\'t Delete Account. The data couldn’t be read because it isn’t in the correct format." After multiple failed attempts and nothing but copy-pasted responses from support, I gave up—only for Tinder to ban my second, and only functional, account. Tinder’s support was completely unhelpful, uncaring, and unwilling to troubleshoot anything. I’ve asked them to reinstate my second, account, but I have no expectation they will even respond. | Update: They replied with a copy-and-paste response directing me to the same exact link where I submitted the appeal to which they were unhelpfully replying!

When my account was unlocked the messaging and match features didn’t work. I was involved in a active conversation when the account stopped functioning so I’m sure there were messages sent to me but on top of that the messages I’m trying to send out don’t register once I leave the message page. Tiles don’t move up the queue like they do when a message is sent normally. I’ve sent messages to several people both in my active messages queue and to new people trying to test if it’s working and nothing is happening. Of people I’m already connected to, their profile is missing the “essential” information; new profiles viewed have the essential section but existing messages don’t. And I haven’t received a match in over a week. I was getting at least 3 super likes a week before and now nothing. Even on profiles that have a yellow tag saying they have already liked me; I select like and it still does match. I have emailed at least 10 times for help and haven’t had a response to a single inquiry. It’s hard enough for people to make authentic connections but to have a dis functioning app get in the way and then know tech support; it might be better to switch to Bumble or anything that actually works.',

It’s unnecessary for you to have to buy your way to the top in the app just to get the chance for more people to see your account or you to see who likes you, it takes away that chance of random things happening to excite you that someone found interest in you. Then I believe that tinder and people who use it, dont delete their accounts or tinder uses them as a bait to keep people on the app. Like there are girls on here who are really good looking that it make me question even if they should be on the app because of how great they look and how they describe themselves. Like it seems like you just get doomed scrolled by tinder from them or past users leaving their inactive accounts on here. And the experiences I’ve had matching have been just awful, the first one ever I had, all I did was say hello and they immediately unmatched me which seemed ruthless, then the second time I had someone sending me a link to get to know them better on onlyfans, like we just matched and your either a real chick trying to get to know me on onlyfans of all places or your just a catfishing scammer. \n\nBut overall the app seems pointless and kinda pay to win.

None of that matters here. The game is all rigged; that vast majority of profiles are fake. Match group does not care about the safety of their male user base; they only care about the money they can take. Even “photo verified” means absolutely nothing anymore; scammers exploit this feature and upload a photo of themselves while their profile is hidden. They then use those photos to “photo verify” their profile. After they’ve “photo verified” their profile they delete all their pictures and upload photos of some attractive woman. Tinder is aware of this and does nothing. I am a highly busy professional and haven’t had the time to “get out” as much as I’d like and apps like these used to be a useful tool to help meet people. Now they only serve to separate you from money while harming your mental health. The few women that are real on here don’t possess the values and virtues that are conducive to happy healthy relations. It seems I’ll have to meet  someone the way everyone else has in the past which is a good thing ! I think we may be heading to a renaissance with so many people waking up to how much harm social media and apps have done to the social fabric of society !',

I’ve even seen women make fake account as men and get matches with people and it’s quite literally making them depressed and frustrated with the app and dislike women because their swipes literally mean nothing. If you do finally match it’s only ever one message and that’s it or it’s a bot. More often than not girls with social media in their bio are bots and are trying to sell OF and I’m just getting really frustrated with the whole premise. The idea behind online dating was to help those who would otherwise not have the opportunity to socialize or properly engage in courtship in a random setting. It’s supposed to be a tool to boost confidence and allow people to engage more. It’s literally now a hot or not app and profiles are literally being scooped off dead social media accounts- they have first and last names- and it’s genuinely not worth anyone’s time or money anymore. Do yourself a favor and save the time and money, find a way to get a Saturday/Friday night off, have *one* drink so your anxiety goes away and just start chatting with people at bars. You’d have significantly better luck and be able to actually gauge why you’re being rejected, rather than dealing with this ever rotting app',

Over time the lack of replys, the bots, the onlyfans farmers and the 1 or 2 actual real person, my self image started to deteriete and my mental health along with it (was I not good enough?) I found myself compromising out of desperation just to get matches which never went anywhere, nothing really works. I slowly figured out that people who actually have success in apps like these are 1) in highly condensed areas 2) are very specific types of people 3) mostly women who swipe right because it gives them dopamine and lastly the people who have success generally don't come back to tinder because why would they? \n\nThe breaking point I got was when I matched with someone in the town I had just moved to and without any warning she sent the first message and it was some pretty hateful / hurtful stuff, I realized then and there that this app had been making me feel worse and worse about myself over time, but because I had grown comfortable with the feeling (plus swiping is a mindless activity anyway) I was okay with my worsening mental health.

What kind of guy are you looking for? and then quickly ask to communicate off the site, usually through WhatsApp. Many of the profiles list them as being 5000 to 7500 miles away which puts them squarely in South Africa, a place that’s known for having warehouses of scam organizations. What’s more if you ask where they are from they pick a city that is far enough away to prevent a casual date, but close enough to seem like it might be a reasonable risk for a relationship. If I press them on where exactly in that city or state they live there is a pause while they Google a map And then they choose a town they think is in that area. Most of the time they get it wrong.. As soon as there is an inconsistency or I’ve challenged them, they immediately unmatch me. I’ve taken a shortcut. If the first thing they ask is what my experience has I say I’ve only met scammers so far and they immediately unmatched me. I cannot believe that this entire site has only scammers..

So many nice profiles are fake accounts and scammers asking you to get on WhatsApp despite having a photo verified on their profile. Fake accounts of people who message you one thing and never respond again. Men desperate for hook ups that won’t try to get to know you unless they can get you to agree to a hook up before even meeting, very transactional mindsets. Then you have people who demand they’re catered to in their profile. After you filter through all of that the quality of people are really bad. If you find someone who knows how to keep a decent conversation going good luck because most do not have serious intentions of meeting. A good looking person with a personality with their stuff together is a rarity. I got tons of matches and thousands of likes but most profiles were fake or dead accounts. This is the worse this dating app has ever been. As I said before; most accounts are highly fake, you get the same cycle of people you swiped left on continuing to pop up and some people who are just plain weird. Most people you’re shown are not attractive. To get to a point where you’d even meet someone on this app is rare because of so many bad actors, scammers or someone trying to manipulate you.

That’s the only thing that should show up and that only women who are looking in men can see me because that is what’s the point of having somebody you have absolutely no interest in finding your profile? someone’s preference is not just going to change just because that person took a leap and swiped on them. so they need to fix this preferably as soon as possible because that’s a waste of our time and severely disrespectful to peoples preference.',

Sad to say but it’s ironically not my choice ———————— Used to be decent. Now they’re giving out free passport apparently?

Different languages, countries, with high language barrier and zero intention to come to your area. It has completely ruined the entire experience and made it impossible to use tinder for what it was created to do — get to know people around you to find a partner / friends.

  'review': 'My feedback in this review couldn’t possibly be more scathing. I’ve used Tinder for years, and it’s been a reliable app throughout that time, with the exception of one recent, crucial incident: I finally matched with someone who is a solid catch, and we’re both mutually excited about each other. I’m pretty picky when it comes to dating, so this scenario isn’t exactly common. However, my ability to respond promptly to my match is undermined by Tinder suddenly breaking down in its functionality: a three minute lag in sending messages (a lag that requires me to keep the app open as the app makes up its mind on whether it’s gonna send the message or not), or not sending my messages altogether. This has resulted in my match and I trying to sustain conversations about finding an app where we *can* communicate with each other at a very early stage in getting to know each other, thus threatening the organic development of chemistry between each other. I would strongly recommend against entrusting this app with enabling reliable communication, especially since it is currently failing me miserably on that front. This is the one time that I was counting on Tinder to work, and it is absolutely failing to deliver on its most basic functions, which is totally outrageous',

All of my photos are appropriate and my bio did not have anything close to being worthy of being banned.\nIt seems like tinder has a very flawed system in which it bans whoever it likes without giving any warning or notifications on why you were banned. This is an abuse of power right here from an app that has too much power. You can’t even appeal the reason why you were banned. It just doesn’t make sense to me. I’ve had my profile since 2015. I have deleted it every now and then to take a break from it. But redownloading it recently and have been using it for the past week, everything was fine. Until today, this afternoon I went onto the app to find out I was banned.\nIf this is how Tinder works and does things, by asking for personal information, wanting a bio and having you do so much to make a profile, just seems like a huge breach of privacy and an abuse of power.\nI recommend anyone that wants to use this app, to not even download it. Because the amount of times I’ve seen my friends use this app, just to get banned for no reason, kind of blows my mind. Again, I highly suggest no one downloads this app at all.',

I paid for Gold and it still does not allow me to do anything on the app. At this point it was a sign I should not have downloaded the app, now I am requesting my money back for such a terrible experience. Paying for something that doesn’t function at all is not great at all. All around the experience was terrible. It ruined the flow of some decent conversations I had with a couple of people.

Now obviously I know not everyone is comfortable with that, that’s why the word transgender was the first thing in my bio so people KNOW. and i get not reading bios and just seeing a pretty face and swiping, so before i started a conversation with anyone i would tell them to read my bio, sometimes i’d get unmatched sometimes i wouldn’t. I had maybe 2 or 3 conversations longer than a few texts because I just wanted to scroll on tinder and see what was out there, but I did meet some actually nice people. I even paid for a weeks worth of tinder plus so i wouldn’t run out of swipes. Within TWO days of being on tinder my account was under review, I figured okay i’m sure some people reported me because that’s the way things are, but tinder will clear it up and I can go back to being on the app. NOPE was banned after i spent over 24 hours under review. I paid 14 dollars for a week and got to use it for less than a day. People that had read my bio and I was genuinely connecting with just gone.

This is Tinder. I have paid for Tinder platinum for 3 months now, I have spent countless hours swiping, editing and adjusting every small detail of my profile, used all the boosts and super likes and still have ultimately made little to zero progress in the dating realm. Now I know what you’re thinking, I must be doing something wrong, being creepy, boring, or not posting the right pictures or something but I try my best to avoid those specific issues as best as possible. I’ve had more success on hinge without even paying a dime for their service and yet here it feels like they are constantly demanding you for money just to be slightly prioritized for a very short period of time. Not to mention the sheer amount of bots, fake accounts, and people simply not using the app, or only using it to promote their brand is frustrating to say the least.

I’m concerned about what’s actually being fix with these updates. Countless updates, yet the algorithm is STILL off. Just today, I swiped on 20 different profiles, then I swiped on a few other and literally the same 20 profiles I had just swiped on came back around in reverse order. Like come on.. Whatever you had in effect a few years ago, bring it back, because you obviously broke something and it appears that you don’t know how to fix it. Tons of people are complaining about the same thing, the rating for this app is constantly dropping, yet, the developer just keeps giving the same robotic responses. Contacting the help desk or whoever is not going to fix this issue..\n\nUpdate: still a lot of bots on the app. Imagine paying $140+ for 6 months of Tinder Gold for bots. Lol!! The app was already failing, so they figured that raising the prices for the subscriptions would help. Whoever that thought that was a great idea should probably be fired.

It could be VIP parties, access to top a network or models, a champagne brunch or it could be exactly the same, I have no way of knowing.

The app also crashes frequently (yes, it’s fully updated). If you’re looking to spend money on a dating app, you’d be better off spending money on Hinge or Bumble. Use the free version if Tinder if you like, but they don’t deserve your money. Also, I have heard from other people who are seemingly arbitrarily banned without any way to challenge or contest the ban. I guess that you can’t be accused of having terrible customer service if you don’t have any customer service to begin with...',

But… Recently I’ve started to see ads in my discovery deck even though I’m currently an active platinum member. I’ve contacted Tinder support a few times about this, and they are treating me like I’m making things up even though I’ve sent them screenshot proof of multiple ads showing up in my swipe deck. Furthermore, if you look at the benefits of being a Platinum member, one of the listed benefits is the ability to hide ads—yet I’m still being shown ads, even though I’ve been subscribed for months, without interruption. This is my second to last resort. If this issue is not resolved I will report it to Apple support that they are scamming paid users by claiming they won’t see ads, and I will cancel my subscription. Like I said, I get pretty good results with this app every month, that’s why I don’t mind paying for it — but with that being said, I’m starting to see way too many bots and scammers on the platform and I’m being shown ads even though I’m paying to not see them. I’m not a fool, and I don’t like being scammed, so maybe it’s time to go somewhere else.',

I initially had the app for 2 months and did not have one match. I decided to buy the cheapest gold membership and then I got a few matches. I thought it was odd. I then decided to go back off gold and then the matches AND likes stopped again. I then bought PLATINUM and the matches STILL were not at the level they used to be two years ago for me. Nothing with me personally or physically has changed almost at all. It is quite clear tinder is now a money grab. Makes it really hard for people like me who work 70+ hours a week in a new city with no connections to even try and make friends let alone find a partner. So unfortunate, but that’s why i’ve now moved to Hinge and they never fail me. Almost 0 fake accounts on there and people are actually trying and you also will get legitimate matches.

Dating apps in general are a joke compared to meeting people in person, but Tinder takes the cake for the very worst right after MeetMe. I guess I’m either too pretty for dating apps, or Tinder (an app for adults I thought? And I was not explicit by any means!) hasn’t been clear enough on what isn’t allowed in bios. Regardless, Tinder lost someone that the vast majority of people would swipe right on, and I lost access to an app that did nothing positive for me, and left MUCH to be desired. I guess I should go to clubs where they only let in women that are too good looking to be real so I can fit in and not be seen as fake, and meet girls as cute as me. But this app was NO GOOD.

In the past couple years they have somehow taken a perfectly decent app and ruined it. The app is very clearly now about maximizing profit at the expense of the user. This is made abundantly clear by shoving paid features down our throats and showing higher quantities of higher liked users only to paying members. Meanwhile non-paid members are left with a limited experience and fewer matches. The decision makers at Tinder are insulting the user’s intelligence by thinking we won’t notice it. The users notice this and are vacating the app. The user base is clearly not as alive as it used to be and I’m sure Tinder sees declining numbers in there regular user count reports. And after putting up with all of this, they have the nerve to randomly ban and delete my account, with zero warning or explanation, thus deleting all conversations I had going. If any other app developers want an example of how to take a decent app and run it into the ground, look not further than Tinder.',

I haven’t gotten one actual date from this app, every date (literal hand full) I have received from this app has turned out to be some kind of money dating scam. \n\nPerfect example: One of the few dates I got, I made arrangements to pick them up for dinner, I even had “extras” planned for the date as a surprise, since I was really interested in the person. But when it came down to the time of arriving. I was standing at the door in the dark cold of winter and I was demanded to pay $100, before I ever even could step inside or even met them. Later coming to find out that this person doesn’t even live at the address they requested I pick them up from. End of the story is that I have not only been scammed by this app paying to find love, but also by the individuals who use this app to scam people, simply wanting to find love.\n\nMy advise for those thinking of downloading the app or paying for the subscription. DON’T! Save your money, your gas, and your time, you’re worth more than that.',

But everything tinder advertises is a lie (for men). In a nutshell, it’s manipulative, it’s buggy, but most of all it just doesn’t work. The app will not push you out, even if you pay, and even if they did, the female to male ratios is said to be 1:9 to 1:15, but if you think about how many accounts are bots, or scams, the ratios are significantly worst, 1:50 seems like an exaggeration, but from my perspective it’s being generous. And that’s what makes the platform not work. It’s artificially inflated, bloat. I’ve used all the features, and in theory a lot of them are awesome, but they all don’t make you any more successful in finding a date because of those ratios. If you go to the clubs, at least your ratios are 1:1, I’ve grown as a person over the year, and I’ve had more success on 1 night at the clubs then my entire experience using tinder. So go to the clubs, just treat the women like people, not meat. Don’t trust the dating apps, anything else is a better use of your time and money, if you are a guy.',

Tinder went what I can only describe as “woke” despite the hackneyed connotations of the terms now, as it tried to not so subtly force its public image to become something more wholesome. Well I’m all fine with that, but I bring it up because I’ve had my account banned absolutely randomly twice now. I cannot for the life of me imagine why, nothing I had said to anyone was controversial or aggressive. In fact, the second time around, I hadn’t even been on the app in a week and change at all, and barely messaged my last few matches because as I suspected and was probably right about, tinder had already dhadowbanned me (again, why?). So don’t bother using this until they reverse their ban decisions. I’d say use hinge, but I’m pretty sure all of these apps are owned by the same heinous corporation, and are all ridiculously overpriced to generate revenue off of majority male loneliness. Not that it matters to me, I have a girlfriend open to me having casual encounters with other women, and I guess these apps hate you now if you use them for their original purpose (;',

There’s no call number, it took ten minutes ten find a place to send an appeal contact, after after all of that i am still banned from this app. This app does not care about users to truly want to find partners or any other consensual interactions with other users.

After a couple back and forth messages, a pop up will appear at the bottom of the screen, covering about 1/3 of the screen. It asks if you are fine with video calls with that specific person.

When you open the keyboard with the pop up still there, it just moves up, covering your conversation. I used to like the app. But in the past year or so, it has gone downhill.

Tinder definitely doesn’t have our best interests if we can get banned for no reason and they still have accounts like that there are still active. The support is terrible. Something needs to change. I’ve used tinder for years and I’m super upset on how things are being handled. I can no longer create new profiles or have any access to my old accounts that I wish to be deleted. How are you gona claim that you want to have a safe plate form, yet allow things like that to happen? You guys really need to work on bettering your support system or you need to be shut down.',

That’s not my problem if it offended someone. Tinder is no different than these other garbage online platforms like Twitter or Facebook with the censorship of our free speech and accounts as a whole.

I submit my ID, and now I am denied access to the platform even though I am 18 and have a valid ID? I emailed the “customer support” (not much help btw), and was told I “violated the terms or service” with no explanation. Not sure which term I violated? I guess they don’t get paid enough to tell you what you did wrong, only enough to tell you you’ve done wrong with no explanation (even when they decision is backed by no fallible evidence). I’m starting to think this company just rolls a dice when they let people join. I know plenty of 14-17 y/o’s on the platform with no trouble, but they somehow follow the “guidelines”. It’s embarrassing for a company to be so lazy and downright negligent when it comes to enforcing rules and paying employees to enforce them. Would not recommend, just go out and talk to people for real, it’s better for you anyways.',

I personally value reviews from users because I’ve had terrible experiences with some applications. After reading that apparently they banned an account without cause or explanation is unsettling, but the fact they gave a generic response to the person when they reached out to support is totally bogus. And the fact they don’t have a support number with live reps make me discouraged. If you have ever had a problem with some program that had horrible support you know what I mean. I would rather use a glitchy buggy app with real people providing high quality support than a nice smooth friendly GUI app that has no support. I wish they would impose regulations mandating these companies to provide phone, email, and chat support. Besides think about it- a person who doesn’t support their product .... I know I take pride in things I do and lack of support says they don’t care about their product/service or their users. Step your game up and stop being greedy losers.

I as well as many others was paying for premium for about a week or two before I went on to my account and it asked me to verify my profile, i did, and it was "processing my verification" for about a day and the next time I tried to log on I was banned. Mind you, I hadn\'t even really been messaging people, and my pictures were all fully clothed selfies with one photo of my cat. So i tried to email support about it and they just started arguing with me saying "You\'ve been banned. We can\'t tell you why" After a few emails back and forth I realized that I wasn\'t going to get anywhere with the conversation and I just left it. But of course, they can continue to charge me even after deleting my account! I had no idea how long I had been banned for as it gave me no notice or anything, I just saw when I logged on. My subscription (of course) was still active. Which sounds a lot like a scam to me. Hopefully this company gets sued or fined or something cause this is not okay.',

First of all, cell phones don’t have static because they’re not analog TVs, so the glitching effect makes no sense. All the ambulances you see are from the 1970s because that’s all they had access to I guess. The sets are tiny and empty, I guess because the portrait aspect ratio doesn’t allow you to see much of the environment, so maybe that’s actually good filmmaking then. Obviously the acting is terrible and they try way to hard to make people sound “hip” and cool. Maybe they based the dialog on all y’all’s chat logs and some of you really talk like that.

Bad thing is, is tinder, hinge and a bunch of other ones are owned by Match Group LLC which is one big monopoly. So if you get banned on one you basically can’t use any of the other big dating apps.

They have reached new lows and only care about the number of times the application is open. Tinder is a complete waste of time. \n\nOld Review: Every account is fake (verified or not), and the notifications are trash. It’ll say “You have one new match!” And when I turn to open the app, there is no new match there. On the rare occasions I do get a match, the notification says “Someone” sent me a contact card and a quick message. Most of the time, it’s a link for a social media account and a suggestion to reach out to them that way (which leads me to believe it’s for money). No faith in this app and will not spend money for it. It won’t make a difference. Do better and maybe I’ll change my mind. Update: this app is still the worst. Fake “matches” and automatically gone in seconds. I firmly believe it is just for the purpose to show people are using the app and that tinder is still relevant. What a joke.',

It’s only $7 for this many.” They don’t care about their consumers, why would they want to? If you don’t get a match and meet someone you will still be a consumer, and as soon as you meet someone, they don’t get your money anymore.

It’s annoying to waste the likes you get for free on fake people and it would be nice to see Tinder crack down on this issue. Altogether, this app works as advertised but QoL would be greatly increased to fixing some of these issues.',

To buy more super likes is now SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive. I might be able to overlook that by citing current economic turmoil…but here’s the reality: Tinder should be paying ME for the amount of work I do reporting fake and scammer profiles. I’d say a good 85% of all female profiles are fake or scam. They use the same tricks every time and it wouldn’t be hard for Tinder to police this. I have an MBA in Data Analytics and I know the capabilities exist to identify and delete fake/scam profiles…however the platform wants it to seem like they have more users, so they do nothing. Drop the prices, control who uses your platform, and give back the benefits you took away. If you don’t do this, the app will die. There are 100 other dating apps ready to take your market share and you’ve just handed it over on a silver platter.

OkCupid has been wholly unresponsive and Tinder support kept reiterating they will not do anything. Neither will let me know if and how the ban originated from either of them.

I don’t know how it’s legal to do that seeing as how some people pay for a premium experience and STILL get shadowbanned, essentially scamming you. I made another profile, didn’t message more than one girl a day and didn’t use any language that would be considered by tinder, inappropriate, and I have consistently been getting matches and likes.

The core frustration stems from its matching algorithm, which appears heavily skewed towards pushing users to purchase premium features. Without a paid subscription, the app teases potential matches that often lead nowhere, showcasing profiles that don't align with my preferences or are simply inactive. This tactic feels misleading, leveraging user hope and patience for profit, which contributes to a disheartening user experience.\n\nMoreover, after investing $120 in hopes of enhancing my chances, the return on investment has been dismal. The lack of meaningful matches persists, and responses from matches are scarce, making it extremely difficult to foster any real connection. This lack of interaction not only wastes financial resources but also takes a toll on self-esteem, as the silence from potential matches is disheartening. Overall, Tinder's model seems more focused on cash flow than genuinely helping users find compatible partners, making it a frustrating endeavor for someone genuinely searching for a connection.",

Unlimited options, especially for women. And for men- we have to spend so much time trying to figure out to stand out to get a match then even more to construct a message. \n\nBut in truth it doesn’t matter because it’s usually based on looks.

How long were they on it? Did they scroll all the way through? A small way to find out if you were swiped right- of the 60 right swipes in a minute- or was there actual interest. \n\nThat can help sift through the numbers. Cut down on some of the exhaustive work and amount wasted time. \n\nI think the other thing is to fix the filters.

Clearly the developers are paywalling basic normal features and functionality but it really seems they are paywalling just getting seen. For reference I spent $50 and have never even had a genuine conversation with someone. Either fake accounts that ghost and sit there in your matches or people that just spam a Snapchat user name and then unmatch you. Unbelievable',

I went to open my app one day and saw I was banned - with no explanation, just referring to the Terms of Service. Good luck trying to get in contact with support. Their support is almost non-existent. They will never respond to emails and their phone number isn’t even in operation. They will wait until you make a purchase for Tinder Gold or any other overpriced subscription, and will ban you with no refunds allowed. If I could give this app zero stars I would. The app is overpopulated with fake profiles, robots, and scammers who seem to never get banned. But don’t worry, Tinder will make sure to ban the good people for absolutely nothing. I cannot tell you the amount of times I have seen a profile with a fully naked person in it, report it, and continue to see the same profile across the app weeks later. This app is absolutely a scam.

It feels like there are no authentic profiles anymore. The few that there are Tinder pushes back on the algorithm so you are forced to pay for their premium services which have also gone up in price significantly and offer much less features. With the basic Gold profile you used to be able to see who swiped right on you and would get 5 super likes a day. Now neither of those features are included and instead are part of much more expensive packages. The once a month boost you would get is also gone. All of this to say that Tinder is dead for the regular users who actually liked the app for being able to connect and interact with people looking for the same thing as you. Its gone and probably never coming back. Other dating apps like Bumble and even Hinge are now much better for dating and meeting people. Say good bye to Tinder it was fun while it lasted',

The apps intentionally hide people around you because if they solve the problem of actually finding people dates, they will go out of business. It makes you wonder why YikYak got discontinued.

I don’t know if the app is seasonal or just like a all year round app or annual app but I use to have great luck with it but people started to get banned and disappear off the app it was no proximate friends close by like bumble so I’m not too sure what happen but bumble is down bad with no commercial so I’m hoping to download soon and become a regular swiper regularly on my account that I can get back.',

However, there are certain things the app does that greatly decrease the quality of the experience. For one, recently, I have found that I cannot open profiles till I match with the person. This means I cannot read the majority of the information. After researching, I learned that this is part of beta testing for a possible future feature. I’d like to firmly say that I absolutely hate this. Also, I often find that the app ignores my preferences, showing me the profiles of literal teenagers. Why have an age filter if the algorithm will ignore it? I also find that often I become matched with people I am sure I never swiped right on. Many of my friends have also experienced this. I also wonder if tinder ever matches me with people who didn’t swipe right on me. In general, why offer features that the app itself than makes obsolete? Make it make sense.',

Please make this a feature it’s what makes the okCupid app (kinda like tinder) better since they have it\n\n•Filter by what they’re looking for \nTired of women who just want to hookup, i’m looking for a friendship that turns into a relationship down the line. I’m not trying to hookup left and right with these women you feel me?\n\n•Scan a valid License in order to create an account\nThis would: 1. Keep bots from flooding the tinder space, 2.

No matter how many accounts I report there seems to be an endless flow of them. This as a user is frustrating since the use of the account is a waste of time due to it not achieving the goal for which it was created. However it isn’t always failing to reach this goal. In order to filter out some of the fake accounts it is in the best interest of the consumer or user to purchase a subscription which in my experience can be a gamble.

Enough of this blue popup message trying to get us to use Super Likes. It gets in the way of important profile information and it’s popping up like every 3rd swipe. Soooo annoying \n\n 3. I’m constantly getting “ghost notifications” - tinder tells me I have a new like or new match and I open the app and there’s nothing there. This happens a couple times a day \n\n 4. Don’t like that Likes expire after 7 days. Seems like many users don’t check the app on a weekly basis so many of these will be missed which is a huge bummer \n\n 5. Although I’m specifically filtering for people within 15 miles of me, I’m constantly getting people that are hundreds, if not thousands of miles away \n\n 6. Let people filter and sort your Likes list. Sometimes I’d like to sort by expiring soon or filter for people I Super Liked or filter for people who are recently active, etc \n\n7. Things that Feeld does that I appreciate: - Tells you if a user is currently online or last time they were online - Their version of Boosts (called Uplift) lasts for 24 hours as opposed to a Boost only lasting a half hour, which makes it a much better value and therefore more likely to utilize - Read receipts are standard and free - greatly appreciated',

However, ever since doing so I stopped getting any likes.

The other issue I have is the fact that some matches are with women in happy relationships wanting to promote their social media pages. \nLastly, I paid for the most expensive edition of the app yet I cannot use a boost but 1x a month without purchasing. Also the fact there are only 6 super likes available after purchasing the most expensive version doesn’t make any logical sense. Why should I be getting bombarded with extra charges to get features I thought I was paying for.

I am super disappointed in tinder. It used to be a fantastic app until the update messed this all up! I will be using OKCupid from now on.

I just feel insulted to be told by the app that gaming isn’t a hobby, so I must fall into one of three categories, either I play Fortnite, league of legends, or both.

This is quite upsetting, especially when I had a active gold membership. Not only that, upon reaching out to customer service they are not able to give me details as to why my account has been banned. I asked them, “ so in the instances that there may have been an accidental ban or a ban that was initiated under false pretense, what do you do?” I have told “representatives” on this customer service system repeatedly that this ban was not justified and I would like to speak to a supervisor. \n\nThis is by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life!

I’ve confirmed that they did not unmatch and in fact just disappeared on my end, because people I’ve already exchanged contact with have told me they still saw me on their side, but on my side they were completely gone, even if they messaged me again. \n2. the search bar has been gone for some time, which used to be a very useful tool for finding older matches, it just makes sense to have this feature built in for convenience sake.',

At one point the app worked perfectly too, but as time’s gone on and more updates come out the UI/UX has gone down a lot. UI features go missing randomly, never to be seen again unless you reinstall. Videos won’t upload; sometimes they won’t even show up. When they do upload, it’s 50/50 on whether or not other’s can see them, as profiles glitch often. As time’s gone on, the app just gets more buggy. I think it could just be the way they’re updating the app, but the experience on Tinder just isn’t what it used to be. It’s a shame because I actually do still like the app, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t displeased/expecting better. Please look into the bugs. A lot of them have persisted thru a few updates',

I was upfront that I was trans—it was right in my profile, so I’m assuming I was literally reported by like 5 or 6 transphobes in my 4 months on tinder and they just went off and banned me for it. I also received multiple transphobic messages, like from a woman who literally displayed the LGBTQ+ Rights tinder interest badge and messaged me “wait, you’re a man, really?” (I am a trans woman, not a man). This was in NYC. Tinder is straight up transphobic, you need to pay people to actually monitor reports and stop banning trans people if you want to quit having such a transphobic reputation. You can’t just give a few different options to self identify gender and say you’re supportive when you constantly ban trans woman for being trans.',

Despite multiple attempts to contact Tinder's support team for an explanation, I received no substantial response or clarification. This lack of transparency and failure to communicate is distressing, especially considering the serious nature of an account suspension. In a platform that promises connections and respectful interactions, it's alarming to see such a dismissive approach to a user's legitimate concerns. This experience has left me questioning the fairness and reliability of Tinder's management of user disputes and complaints. For anyone considering this app, it's important to be aware that you may face unjustified account suspension with little to no recourse or explanation from the support team. My experience reflects a concerning lack of accountability and customer care from Tinder.",

I really believe that the same Tinder hire people to keep you texting here and using fake profiles to keep you paying a membership lying to you that someone really like you and may want to know you. If you are not able to have a video call during your first month of membership I will strongly suggest you to stop making payments here. All those LIKES are mostly FAKES. I renewed my membership several times after the expiration thinking that someone like me. Now I believe that this app generates fake likes using fake profiles only to keep you paying.

Instagram pictures don't display properly, app freezing after I send a message, and not to mention seemingly fake profiles and scammers frequently showing up on my feed. \n\nI upgraded to tinder platinum because regular tinder is a joke but here, it’s still bad. It claims to give 5 new super likes a week and one boost a month BUT they don’t compound (use em or lose em). This is a scam considering super likes don’t really add up to anything. Many times, you get shown a profile that has been inactive for months and Tinder goes on to prompt you to use your super likes (mind game manipulation) because the person’s profile is “popular” and you’ll get a better chance to match (matching is meaningless) I doubt the legitimacy of what Tinder is proposing and think they just want you to burn your super likes so you buy more. Also, many use the app to re direct you to other apps (snap/instagram thirst traps/scams) or onlyfans 🙄\n\nImprovements: increase standards for entry. Only verified accounts. Make reporting scammers/fakes/bait easier. Fix bugs. Stop with the manipulative prompts. Transparency. Compound superlikes and boosts. Allow to delete old matches we didn’t message.

I emailed them because there is literally no other way to get a hold of someone and was told that my account was fine and it hadn’t been hacked which was obviously not true since it had none of my pictures up any more so a few weeks later I tried to get on again to do some more investigating and learned that my account had been blocked because of violations of tinders rules so I emailed them again and got back a a generic email stating that my account violated rules and they were not reversing any decisions at this time. It obviously was not looked at by any real person because I tried emailing back again and got nothing else. I’m not sure how this app can be any more horrible completely ridiculous',

Tinder deleted her profile immediately after I sent her a super like(which I highly doubt lol) 2. Tinder is pushing fake profiles for catfishing(which is more believable) or 3. It’s just a bug/glitch(which is also believable and what most likely happened although I don’t believe this to be the case).

The user agreement is fairly straightforward (basically don’t be rude or use inappropriate language) but even when using the app and following the rules all it takes is someone to report your account to get your account banned. Tinder doesn’t have a review system in place they just automatically block accounts with no appeal option. With the being said when you spend money on tinder it’s very irritating to get ghost banned and loose your matches/ money. I found tinder to be a fun app at first but it definitely makes you spend money to get any results. I used to have a tinder 6 years ago it was no where near as expensive as it is now. I would honestly recommend hinge over tinder because they have a great customer support system that will help you out if you have these types of account troubles.',

I’m sure a large portion of your revenue comes from male users, for many reasons.\n\nOne feature I noticed on Hinge that I thought was excellent was the limitation on unread messages. If a user has five unread messages, they can’t continue until they’ve checked them. I believe Tinder could implement a similar system, possibly with a limit of 10 or 15 unread messages.\n\nMy personal experience with Tinder has been disappointing. Many users seem either fake or distracted to the point where they don’t remember previous conversations or even recognize you when you reach out via text after exchanging numbers.

And the creators don’t seem to be interested in fixing problems 1 or 2. And there are ways for them to fix problems 1 and 2.\n\n3) they come out with some new feature but puts it behind yet another pay wall. The app now has 5 things to pay for 3 of are Subscriptions. Tear 1 about 50$ a year subscribers get unlimited swipes and 5 super likes plus no adds. Tear 2 about 150 year you get everything from tear 1 plus you see who liked you before you match. Now they have a tear 3) about 200$ a year which just came out this year you get everything from tear 1 and 2 but now you can send a msg too someone after super likeing them. Then you can buy super likes and boosts. They just keep comping up with more and more ways to make you pay but never improvement on the environment.\n\nKnow even though they have Thea’s problems the app is still has its good parts it’s just a pain that you have to muddle through garbage just to find one or two people that are actually interested in dating.',

In 6 months or so I didn’t get a single match. I was paying for their private feature so if I wasn’t getting any matches, I wanted my money back. I emailed them and said that if you’re shadowbanning me I want a refund. The lady looked into it and said they’ll send me a refund—basically acknowledging that I was being shadow banned. Again—the only change I made was adding a watermelon to my bio. I looked up the owner and he is Jewish. Not that being Jewish means you’re a Zionist but in this case, I can only assume that’s the case. Avoid this app. And do better Tinder.',

(This is all of course, if you’re male. Tinder primarily focuses on manipulating men out of money.) I truly believe tinder sells “anti-products.” Which means when you pay they actually worsen your odds in order to keep you paying.

I’ve met some amazing girls, there is one who is really sweet, I’ll talk a little more but I am willing to drive hours to take this girl on a date sooooo. I don’t like how I can’t get unlimited likes or more than what I have for 12 hours. There no limit to love so why limit the potential for it? Paying for that stuff is just corporate bs that needs to be left behind. Let this be something good for the world not something that feeds off of it. This is an app and a website not Apple. You don’t need to make a bunch of extra features or take pre-existing ones and try and make people pay for it. Also it’d be cool to make another app for different religions. Like Tinder Christian, Tinder Islam, Tinder Judaism, etc. just an idea for y’all.',

There’s literally people who say “I’ll stab you if you voted for trump” and these people have colored hair too but that’s fine as long as it’s hateful towards something people don’t like. Please just delete tinder off the App Store and hopefully you people can’t find a job after… good luck socializing with people!',

(If you buy it, be sure to cancel auto renew so that they aren’t able to steal your money once you’re done!)\n\nHowever, I come to check my purchase history and see they charged $50. $20 for tinder plat and THIRTY DOLLARS for 5 super likes a day. When they display the ad/prompt to purchase tinder plat, on the last page, it says: “includes top picks, 1 boost a month, 5 super likes a day, rewind, and passport.”\n\nAnd it says TWENTY DOLLARS. Not 50. So I called apple support and reported the theft. Should be getting my refund soon for the 30. Check your purchase history! I’m sure if enough people report this to Apple, they will step in because they are literally charging over double what they’re telling apple that they’re charging.',

What it seems happened was that someone must have been offended by something in my Bio and reported me and whoever reviewed it must have agreed. Even though I never put anything offensive in my bios and I don’t post provocative photos. I’m respectful to everyone I chat with. Yet, somehow I got the boot and Tinder has no appeals process. It’s probably for the best since they charge for basically everything on the app. It’s almost like prostitution. Because most people use it to hook up and Tinder gets to profit off people paying for more views and interactions. I’ll head somewhere else that doesn’t boot you for childish reports. I will never recommend Tinder to anyone. If you’re trying to find love, don’t use Tinder. If you offend someone, expect to get Device Blocked (Cxxk/pxxxy blocked) by Tinder.',

The really annoying part is that they always come back no matter what I do. I’ve tried swiping left, unmatching them, blocking them, reporting them, deleting them, nothing. They’re just always there.\n\nEverything else about the app is fine, the ads show up often but I can easily get rid of them. I get a lot of matches with people that don’t respond even after I text them but that may be just a me thing. As a selective swiper, I can swipe on at least 30 women before I run out of swipes. It is very nice how you can send unlimited messages at no cost. When someone deletes their account, you can’t get rid of it, it’s just a gray profile that sits there in your matches. \n\nThat’s all I got for now, hope it helps and good luck finding what you’re looking for.',

  'review': 'I made a Tinder to meet friends, I read the guidelines, explored other profile bios to see what’s appropriate and how ppl are using the app before completing my bio etc. Not even 24 hours after I downloaded the app I get a notification that my profile is “banned for sharing sexual content.” I had no such thing on my profile, completely respectable photos that I use on my other social media, and nowhere near anything that would violate community guidelines. They allowed me to “appeal” the action only for them to immediately deny the appeal with no explanation and no example of how I “violated community guidelines” with my profile. I don’t need to use the app, but the accusation they have on record to “ban” my profile with no explanation is really inappropriate and discriminatory on Tinders behalf and I truly don’t appreciate being accused of something so specific not even 48 hours after being new to the community. 0/10 RECOMMEND',

Easily more than 40% of accounts I come across are clearly scammers, but unlike other dating apps, Tinder refuses to take the steps that could end this (such as requiring accounts to be verified and preventing users from switching out the photos on an account after it’s verified). And contacting them repeatedly about this to see what they’re doing about it has just gotten me blown off by customer service. Again, this isn’t a significant issue on the other apps (Bumble, Hinge, League, OKC, etc.), so it’s obviously solvable. And Tinder are obviously aware of the issue, so it’s hard not to conclude they are just fine with their legitimate users being preyed on by criminals so long as their engagement metrics are being met. I’ve been a paying user for quite a while, but I’m done. They won’t get another dime from me. Download something different. Your time will be better spent.',

It will not tell you this has happened instead you will just continue to spend money with no results, and no clue that this is going on ( stealing if you ask me). If you are shadow banned from my understanding it’s not as simple as just creating a new account. You cannot use the same Phone number, Apple ID, or Facebook. Also could be linked to your IP address.

I was constantly bombarded with ads to upgrade to a premium membership, and strangely, I would only be shown a very select number of people around me (not to mention they drastically reduced the number of swipes you get), so I finally just signed up for a premium account. A day later my account was banned, for no explicable reason. Zero community standards violations had been committed, and I hadn’t even been messaging with anyone recently. I appealed it. The appeal was denied. I reached out numerous times, just to ask for verification of what I had done to get banned. All they said was, “You must have broken a community standard.” No explanation. \nBUT HERE’S WHERE THE SCAM PART IS: after banning people, they CONTINUE TO CHARGE/AUTOMATICALLY RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE ACCOUNT THEY WON’T LET YOU USE!!!',

Imagine the reaction when he meets the person in real life. It could result in not only very hateful comments but potential violence.\n\nGive them their own category so people can choose the type of person they want.

I have liked 5 Angela’s not a single match and none of the others say you missed your match. How do I match with people that aren’t there. It’s pretty obvious they put up fake likes almost as soon as you register, so you pay to see who they are. In my opinion you’re never going to match with them because it doesn’t seem like they’re real. I’d also like to state I live in a rural area, I expanded my search radius to 70 miles and set the age 18-50. I also ran out of matches 7 to 8 times continuously expanding the search radius, still found none of the women who liked my profile.',

However, I just recently downloaded again and tried logging in, and found out I am still banned - although I was previously informed this would be reversed.  I messaged customer support for help and explanation, to which the only information and statements they are able to provide is me across multiple correspondences is “Your account has been banned for violations of our Terms of Use or Community Guidelines, which we take very seriously.”\nThis app and the quote unquote support is an absolute joke; doesn’t even deserve 1 star.',

I did NOTHING wrong and when you try to email their support email some robot gives you some preset answers that ask what the problem is, you give a screenshot of the error message and then it tells me what I already looked up, that I am banned but they will not tell me what rules or conditions I supposedly violated.

The ad revenue isn’t enough for them and my friends that have been successful on the app after it became a cash grab paid for boosts (they lied about it ofc, but I caught them in their lie). I used to have pretty good luck on here back when Tinder was relatively new, but now it’s just a waste of time and after the first day of being a free member it’s clear no one sees my profile (I’ll rack up likes the first day, then suddenly nothing). It’s obvious why it works this way and resetting your account doesn’t cut it anymore. Tinder also has next to zero respect for GDPR and won’t disclose all of the information they keep on you (Google it). I wouldn’t be surprised if they are doing shady things with your information (which includes their method of sabotaging the effectiveness of a profile reset).',

  'review': 'Firstly, the ways in which the app attempts to push you to buy premium are incredibly irritating. From regularly reminding you to use your super likes (free users only get one per day) to withholding matches (they will tell you “match with ____ when you buy tinder gold” but will not display that profile in the stack) it creates a poor user experience. \n\nI could complain about bots, prostitutes, ads, or scams but that’s all common knowledge with this app. \n\nThey will regularly insert advertisements into you matches without prior warning. I have even gotten “new match” notifications only to find that my “new match” is an ad for something I do not care about in the slightest. I have no issue with ads being placed in the stack but I do not want to be told I have a match and get all excited only to find “smile direct club”.\n\nThe final issue with this app isn’t even with the app itself. The culture it has allowed to exist in the app is one of “gaining a small ego boost” from a match rather than actually meeting up. I have met up with people from bumble and other apps before but it seems like most people on tinder have little interest in using this dating app for dating. \n\nTwo stars because it’s a good concept but since Facebook bought them the app has been awful.',

Whack. \n\nI’d recommend bumble or hinge. \n\nHinge you don’t getta ton of likes a day, but it’s pretty accurate to your area, no bots, n you don’t have to pay to get to the point. You can see who likes you, n message upon a like from the get go. Like bumble they offer prompts so you can get an idea of who someone is more then a short bio/pics. \nTinder should step up their game, as well as decrease their prices if they wanna continue to be a viable “datin” app. Soon this will be a cess pool of incels n AIs goin at it hahaha',

The feature to see who’s swiped yes on you doesn’t work, I know this because often I’ll have no “likes” shown, but when I swipe, I’ll match with people right when I swipe yes on them. This means they had liked me already and didn’t show up in the likes page. I understand having bugs, but considering Tinder’s other practices, I’m not willing to give the benefit of the doubt. Considering this is arguably the only useful feature on tinder, the fact that it doesn’t work is unforgivable. \nTinder does not care about you and will not hesitate to use shady tactics, manipulation, and predatory behavior to separate you from your money. Sure you might meet somebody, but you’re equally likely to both be scammed, and also end up in a depressive state because of the unhealthy environment.',

There are some methods for filtering matches that highlight aligned interests, however I’d very much like an option to only have verified profiles with either the blue camera mark or the blue check mark next to their profiles.

Furthermore, they charge a ridiculous price just to see who swiped right on you.

Bios are often empty and the info the prompts provide aren’t helpful when looking for a significant other. The app has also become more and more manipulative and shallow. As a male using the app, your profile will be nearly invisible to others unless you pay for a boost. The super like used to be free and now you have to pay. When you do pay you don’t get at least one a day. You get 5 and have to wait 5 days for them to refill. Now that the super like is pay only they don’t work. If you super like someone they are turned off by the idea that you are paying for the app. It’s become an absolute garbage application for what it’s intended for and it’s eating its self alive.

It would get rid of the accounts that are “spam” and would create a safer environment for people to meet others. \n\nI’m not sure how the whole verification process works. I know that you take two pictures in certain poses and then I guess a team of people decided if those pictures you take match the certain poses.

And or have a mode where you only see verified accounts!\n\nI do believe that every account should be verified upon joining/making a tinder!

It gives the user a limited amount of swipes in the free version which is not a set number and on average recieves a lot more “like” swipes when the user also adds in “dislike” swipes in the mix almost as if the app is trying to feed on desperation to get the user to purchase the higher subscription, which has skyrocketed in the short term with even less results than previous forms of the premium service.',

If you want to play the game of swiping on the toilet with no intention to meet anyone, it’s the app for you. \n\nHere are the reasons it’s now a failure:\n1. I have set my distance to 20 miles. Without fail, it shows me profiles that are thousands of miles away, or people who live in a far away country that magically show a distance of 6 miles away. All of those profiles you will magically match with, if you swipe right. Why? Because they have all paid to have their profile promoted to more people. Most likely so they can list their instagram and get more followers. \n2. I have set my profile to show me only profiles that associate as “Men”. Profiles of women show up frequently regardless.\n3. Profiles I have swiped Left to more often than not, show up 3-5 more times. No idea why, they swiped right? They pay?

No reasoning or explanation as to how I “violated the community guidelines”. I’ve spent $ on their overpriced memberships in the past which were obviously cash grabs. I’m a little bit upset because I was actually enjoying some of the people I matched with. I’ve met some really great guys over the years and some not so great but this is a new low for Tinder.

These pop ups “incentivize” you to make purchases such as tinder plus or gold so you can receive benefits that will enhance your matchmaking abilities. It begins to feel like a game. Also, this isn’t really the developer’s fault, but people rarely talk anymore. They’ll swipe on you then either A) not message you or B) ignore your messages. It’s a shame.

Little did I know that most profiles on tinder are not real profiles.  They are mostly cam girls trying to get you to talk to them on Instagram.  When you get to Instagram they get you to spend money on a cam girl site.  I did not talk to any real women interested in actual dating.  I soon caught on and begin to tell girls that wanted my Instagram that I was not looking for a cam girl.  After doing that I was mysteriously banned from Twitter.  I was never able to find anyone from tinder that could explain why I was banned.  My theory is tinder allows the cam girls on to appear to have pretty girls that are wanting to date.  By the way I had paid for a year subscription and there is no one to actually talk to to try and get money back.  Beware of this site if you are really looking for love or dating.',

Also, when you do get a match, it’s probably a robot or a girl selling her onyfans.

I don’t like tinder &amp; it should be removed from the app, sorry not sorry. If it’s because of a chick that doesn’t like me, that’s petty &amp; childish too. TINDER SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE APP STORE!!!!!! LIKE NOW!!! Please &amp; thank you',

I didn’t join to text women i will ever meet, i joined to actually go on dates.  I swipe right on most of the women i browse through and have used super boosts often but i feel like I'm wasting my time and money.  I really regret joining back up and wish i could get a refund.",

I Connected with interesting and creative people that eventually became some of the most valuable connections of my life whether they were romantic or platonic. I haven’t had a connection like that in a while because I can’t seem to match with any one as much as I used to. When I started paying for tinder platinum, I was on a spotlight and felt I got consistent and compatible matches and now I don’t. Even when I pay for a boost I end up matching with maybe one or two people. I have wasted and when I say that I mean TRULY WASTED a lot of money on this app to no avail. I refuse to recommend tinder at all these days and I will be deleting the app very soon. I used to enjoy tinder and now it just feels like a complete waste of time and money.',

I also had to prove with photos three times… I was barely on the app for a day when I got the first re-verification requirements. Making anything more unique or personal costs more. I also kept getting repeat people on discovery and at some point I could tell it wasn’t actually registering my swipes at all. Went to delete my account and it just said it couldn’t. Then there isn’t a customer service line to help so all I can do is black out my profile which makes sense now as to why there are so many blank profiles on here. This is truly embarrassing for a company to have this many bugs and issues unresolved as the dating app industries have so much competition.',

  'review': 'After taking a break I downloaded tinder and set up an account. Within two days my account was banned even though I had adhered to community guidelines, just like I had for the previous 3+ years that I have used tinder. They have little explanation if your account is banned and because of the ban on tinder, I am unable to use other apps for dating. Tinder has been a source for dating as an LGBTQ member because it provides a more statistically equivalent dating pool as heteronormative society without dating apps. However, now that Tinder has banned me and is making false claims to have a functioning appeal center and creating problems without solutions, I express my disappointment and the stress of having the opportunity to even date someone because Tinder had a choice in setting barriers. Absolutely inexcusable.',

  'review': 'While I think it’s great and encourage people to do whatever they wish with their lives, on top of the real, human matches, there are constant bots matching with me all day long and sending bogus snapchat/onlyfans links. Usually it’s easy enough to clear out, but lately it’s been a constant throughout the day, every day. Tinder wasn’t like this previously.\n\nEdit after being given condescending, generic instructions to “report” suspicious accounts: I have always reported every suspicious account I find, especially when I am immediately sent a snapchat or onlyfans out of the blue, and it significantly adds to the time I spend on the app to the point of where I spend approximately 40% of the time on the app interacting with actual human beings and 60% of my time reporting fake accounts.

For the past three weeks, I have encountered difficulties using the app.\n\nDespite having a six-month subscription, I am unable to match with other users or send messages. Additionally, there seems to be a recurring problem where the same profiles keep reappearing each time I swipe, indicating a potential issue with my account.\n\nI\'ve attempted to delete my account multiple times due to these challenges. However, every time I try, I receive an error message instructing me to "try again later." This has been a frustrating experience, compounded by the lack of response from the support team.\n\nI understand technical issues can arise, but the inability to address this matter or receive any form of acknowledgment from the support team is disappointing and disheartening.\n\nI kindly request immediate assistance in either resolving these issues with my account or facilitating the deletion of my profile. I hope for a prompt and effective resolution to this matter.\n\nThank you for your attention to this urgent concern. I appreciate your prompt assistance in this regard.\n\nNick',

  'review': 'The people on tinder are very nice and friendly. I’ve met some great friends on there and loved the experience. However without warning, my account was wrongfully banned. The app only said I had violated the terms of service somehow and didnt give me a chance to correct my account. After contacting support, which took them a couple days to respond, they could only repeat what the app said, that I was banned and gave no further explanation or chance to change anything. The support team wasn’t even support and could’ve been robots with how dry, cold, and unhelpful they were. Each email I sent was answered by someone new, saying the exact same lines. The whole experience left a very bitter taste and a fully unhappy customer. I really like the app, but the people who run it are not good at all sadly :/',

  'review': 'This is my experience in my 2years being on tinder. I’m a woman seeking men. At least half of all male verified profiles are scammers (men who asked me for money and are not who they claim). Another 25%to 30% are men looking to cheat. So it leaves you with 20-25% of genuine singles. If you are not a paying member ,not worth the price. you’ll eventually be shadow banned (not viewable to others) or perm banned for a made up violation of terms of service. As a genuine single woman I was banned for no reason along with few friends I know whom are also genuine singles. this reduces the availability of singles and matches to paying members. Tinder expects payment for a service they don’t provide. They create an illusion so you’ll continue to pay yet have no intention on actually matching you with anyone. I’d stay away. I haven’t tried other dating apps yet.',

They give you no way to cancel it, request a refund, or get any kind of technical support. Tinder has a thousand ways to rip you off.", 'Tinder\'s response is pointless. My problem is not addressed in troubleshooting. I have found no way to communicate, as my email sends to have been ignored. With a platinum membership I\'m supposed to be able to message "super likes", but 2 I\'ve sent through the "verified" selections have not given me the option of messaging. Customer service is impossible to reach. All I\'ve found are broken links and I\'ve been given the runaround everywhere I\'ve tried.', "I feel like this app has gotten significantly worse over the years. When I first started using the app, it was full of bots and now, it's still full of bots, breaks features (like Spotify integration) constantly, and finds the need to monetize EVERY LITTLE THING. Good luck trying to get one singular person from their support team to help with anything because they'll just swap with somebody else every hour until they just give up and close the ticket. Tinder, fix your buggy, bot-infested app.", "Whatever you do, don't turn off your auto renew on your subscription until just before your subscription ends. I turned it off right after Tinder charged me, and instead of letting me finish the week that I paid for, they just took my subscription away completely but still charged me. The price for a subscription doubled when I went to go buy it again. It's absolutely ridiculous that it's impossible to get a refund because you can't talk to anyone. Tinder just leads you in circles. 😠", "Absolute waste of time. Honestly, it's probably worse than just wasted time. There is a place for online dating, but this app puts a massive pay wall at every turn. Even setting that aside, it is still full of either fake profiles and/or girls that just want an ego boost. Men on this app have a better chance of getting hit by lightning than actually getting a good match. You would be at least 10x more likely to find someone to date at church or the bar. Also women need to step up the bio game", "Really sucks when the app itself seems like it's trying to prevent any conversations from happening. Like for example when you have a match that you're talking to completely disappear (assuming she unmatched) but when you reload the app a week later it turns out you have an unopened message from them that never showed up before. Really annoying, very buggy app, fix it", "This app has been the genesis for some really important relationships in my life, but DAMN it's so annoying to use. I have to log back in (with forced 2FA) basically every time I open the app, sometimes it will freeze every time I click the settings icon/change my age range or distance settings, and sometimes it works fine! The aggressive dark-patterns and pushes to purchase premium are scummy too. Just go to concerts and bars instead, you're more likely to actually talk to people.", 'No matches unless you upgrade. Then you\'re getting secret admirers that you already received before. So you\'re basically paying for the same thing, over and over. Also, you have to remove your payment method when you sign up for the upgrades because if you simply "cancel" the upgrade with how the app functions right now, it won\'t work and you\'re going to be getting charged, as I have just found out. Absolute trash.', "Constant popups that get in the way of app operation makes the UX feel annoying and stuttery. Like the undismissable floating bubble for super likes which blocks all view of bio and info when swiping. Many of the popups are for super likes, which I imagine is an extremely rare use case for most. Also there are no options to disable 'reminder' notifications. And the functionality for sorting when dragging/arranging photos on your profile is not good.", "9/8/22 I get notified that I have a new match and when I go to click on it, it's no longer there. This has happened when I go to message a match too. This has happened in the past and the matches will reappear randomly but so far they haven't. All my current matches are mixed up and the most recent conversation isn't even on the top. Fix your app. I've been using tinder for years and this is the worst I've seen it malfunction. 10/18/23 same issues are still occurring", 'The app is a buggy, awful mess and the support agents are incompetent (coming from somebody who has years of experience in product support). I upgraded to Tinder Gold, but am unable to access any of the paid features in the app because of a bug, and somehow according to Support the issue is unfixable and there is no way to refund me. Absolutely unacceptable. I will be following up as many times as needed to get the service that I paid for OR a full refund and will be accepting no less.', 'App doesn\'t work. No customer support. The Guide page is useless. Same profile show up in the stack. I can view profiles in the stack but app crashes when I attempt to view a match\'s profile. Unable to get new matches. Keep getting the "failed to match error". No incoming messages but I get text message replies when I send my phone # to matches. I have tried everything in the troubleshooting guide. Upgraded my phone from Galaxy A4 to S23 Ultra and still nothing. Does not work on web browser.', "This app is a hit or miss as it is with all the Bitcoin scammers, but the notifications system is broken and has been for over 5 months. Sometimes I get the notifications for matches and after I restart the app is when the matches would show up. But after that messaging feels like a game of tag because the notifications won't work after someone responds. I have potentially missed on matches because of this. I am paying for premium but getting a subpar experience. Make it free if you can't fix.", "The app fails to function properly. I get solid matches and have good convos and then all of a sudden my discovery is the same girls every time, (even if I swipe left or right) I can't view my match's profiles anymore, (Not just one, all of them) and I can't even delete my account because it errors out! I've been using Tinder on and off for years and only now am I suddenly experiencing these issues. I even created a new account and the issues are back already. I'd rather pay for Bumble", 'It\'s good for getting dates, but the app itself is awful on Android. It\'s very buggy and glitchy, and I get stuck in weird prompt loops at times and have to restart it to get out. The filter options do not actually work most of the time, and it shows me people outside of my age and distance ranges, even when there are girls who arent. There is also no option to remove stickers on your account, so I have a "happy pride month" sticker on my card in August, which just makes me look like a dummy!', 'Don\'t pay for it. It\'s a cool app, but there is a glitch with the premium features under Likes You. If you add any filter to the Likes, it restricts you to 20 results, rather than letting you scroll through all the filtered Likes. This is only an issue on the app as of the recent week or two. I submitted a support ticket, provided a recording showing the issue and was told, "Unfortunately, this is all the support we’re able to offer at this moment. We appreciate your time and understanding."', "The functionality is basically gone. Swipes won't register, and once you swipe the first time, it shows you're out of swipes and keeps cycling through the same people but won't tell you that nothing is actually happening. I can message my old matches, but cannot view their profile and pics, any attempt will boot you out of the app. Changing distance and age range also has no effect, and changes won't save anyway. The constant ad profiles are garbage too, but at least that much is intentional.", 'I used to be able to easily remove myself from the stack. Now the setting to enable or disable the discovery feature is hidden and it tries to get you to pay for a premium feature instead of just turning off discovery. On top of that the setting has never changed for me no matter how many times I have gone into settings and turned off enable discovery. Being able to turn off tinder without deleting my profile was important to me. Will be looking at other apps.', "The location is extremely lacking on profiles. I have to use a map app to ensure profiles are actually in the state as I've had several searches day a city and that they're 10-20 miles away and they are in another state! Sometimes across the country! It would help if they put not only city, but also state in the location. The distance can also be fixed for better accuracy.", 'Customer support is horrible. Constantly just copy and pasting the same thing over and over. Not actually communicating. No phone number for support either. I would buy the standard boosts and I would get prime time boosts instead. Also charged for them as well. They would run automatically while I was traveling. What a scam. Also unable to get verified. The new AI verification simply does not work no matter what I would do with lighting or anything else in their FAQs and CS responses.', 'Designed to waste money, customer support is trained to be unhelpful. "SUPERLIKES" are something you pay for. The app is designed to constantly shoot up a big pop up bubble to remind you to use it. If you accidentally touch that bubble, it automatically uses a superlike. You are supposed to get it back if you are a subscriber and "undo" the like immediately, but you do not. Support refuses to help. Tinder is a scam designed to bleed you for money.', 'Piece of junk. It seems impossible to get even a single match. After going through the stack once, any new entries are junk. No profile. Can\'t see face. Cynical. Not so much a problem with the app, but it\'s a miserable experience. User profiles are bare bones. There\'s a list of "Passions" that you can choose from, that really don\'t make sense. You can select "Atari" but not "Video games." You can\'t write in your own. There\'s minimal selection for who you\'re interested in. Man/Woman, age range.', 'Have had a lot of the "your account has been banned" notification. Even though I\'ve done nothing wrong and after uninstalling the app for a while it usually fixes it. But it\'s very frustrating not having access to my account. Customer service even said they see nothing wrong with y account on their end. But it shows it on multiple devices for me. Idk but it\'s VERY irritating.', "This app could be good, and is under certain circumstances, but once you've messed up your algorithm no one will ever see you and you'll just be cursed to swiping endlessly on people that will never see your card on their stack. Also the premium features are nice but the price has increased exponentially to a point where I don't think I'd ever be able to financially justify even the lowest tier. Like a lot of apps, Tinder has only gotten worse and worse as time goes on.", "Every time I open the app since downloading several days ago, I'm met with a screen to verify my profile with photos. When I go to take the photos, the buttons don't work meaning I can't actually verify my account. I can't use the app at all, not even to delete my profile. Support has been giving canned responses which don't actually address the issue. Kind of a bummer.", "Well I been trying about a month pretty much each day. The reason is this app isn't letting me click on the profile with the person I am chatting with, to see their profile and distance. Messages aren't going out or coming in. I had Tinder for many years! Didn't ever have a problem like this. I uninstalled and reinstalled Tinder about a dozen times! Still same problems. Not getting new matches and I travel alot so my location is always in new areas. Very disappointed. Tinder fix this 😠 😡 😤 !", "The app does next to nothing about the constant stream of fake accounts, likely because this gives you a seemingly high number of anonymous likes, which pressures you into buying premium to see them. (Which I've had from the start) For example, every day or so I would get a new like, from a new account, exactly 30 miles away. Dozens of these. The app isn't designed to find you matches. Its designed to string you along for as long as possible to keep you paying for it.", 'Practically unusable - gets stuck on "Finding people near you" and other tabs don\'t load content either. The content does eventually load bit by bit, taking multiple minutes for each tab. Images then take even more time to load in, sometimes never actually loading. Other apps don\'t have the same issue and speed tests don\'t show any issues. Edit: no way to undo an accidental swipe without paying. Overall frustrating experience.', "I used Tinder off and on for a few years now and I tried their subscriptions. The UI is a lot better than most dating apps. And at first I got a decent ammount of matches. The past 2 years I almost never get matches in my homw town, common places I visit, or areas I commute to. I've updated profile pictures, changed my bio, and adjusted my preferences multiple times but nothing changes. Why would I continute to pay for the extras you get with Plus and Gold if it barely produces any results?", 'Pretty good as far as meeting people goes; if you have decent photographs of yourself. I dropped two stars for the internal Ad system. I paid for the top plan in hopes of avoiding Ads, but to no avail. The app is riddled with internal ads. I never know if any button I tap will be for a feature I have, or a request for more money. Probably not worth paying for more than the lowest plan.', "I had a billing question, and their customer service team was quick to respond but never actually answered my question. It was like talking to a really bad AI. Also, they nearly doubled pricing in the last year, at a time when everyone is moving to other apps. I've been paying for this app for years, but I'm getting better dates from Hinge and Bumble recently, and between that, the egregious 80% price hike, and the poor customer support, I'm not going to pay anymore.", "I don't know why it is so popular. Same money draining app like others. When you upgrade, you will be swapping pictures of dead profiles or fake ones. Very limited filter option reduced to age and distance. Still using it. Sometimes suggesting profiles from the other part of the globe even if distance limits are applied. Still no option to filter inactive profiles and there is plenty od them. Really annoying.", "Tired of getting nonsense notifications. Tried to disable the ones that aren't relevant to me, and was pleasantly surprised to see there were options to do so. I was immediately UNpleasantly surprised to find that when I tried to disable anything, it would kick me to my devices notification settings. Upon returning to the app, anything that I had disabled before being kicked had re-enabled itself. If this is a mistake, that's pretty pathetic. If it's not, that's just shady as hell. I'm out.", "Somehow, this app went from being somewhat decent to just being a pile of trash, which has had me cancel my Gold membership as of now. - There are parts that are either too specific or not specific enough. - Discovery Queue gives you NOTHING related to what you're looking for. - Top Picks show you profiles completely unrelated to your selection and usually consist of blank, instantly put-together profiles. - Filters don't work at all. You end up paying more and more for worse and worse.", "access to others is locked behind microtransactions that really just open up more microtransactions. except they're not so micro. This app has so many blinking lights, pop up dialogues, and requests to do things that you don't care about that it's really just layers of banner ads on top of each other with very little functionality.", "Half of all profiles are fake! Tinder doesn't do anything about them either. Some obvious fakes a even have verifications from them. Also makes everyone's photos look so smoothed out and takes quality and details out of them. Also incredibly basic when uploading your profile photos, there's no option to view albums on your device, only to see latest photos. Terrible app", "The worst app I've ever used, no exaggeration. Many times profile pics do not load. It's slow. Outdated. Embarrassment. It's like something still in trial development in 2010. And the only free part is you can scroll through profiles mindlessly - anything else u got to pay. Again even the marketing 'free' is pathetically outdated and I cant believe they get a pass for calling it free. I wish only bad things for this business. Bad product, slow, clunky, misleading, greed mongers. A disgrace.", 'This is ridiculous! App features don\'t even work. I need to verify my passport in Japan and I\'ve submitted many many times with the double page easily seen and it won\'t work!!! So I have a paid subscription and I can\'t even use the application! I contacted support many times but they just reply back with "here are a few tips with your problem" no the problem isn\'t me, it\'s your shifty application.', "Awful UI experience. It's clunky and takes up far too much space from things you actually wanna see. Not to mention that the only consistent notification you get is if you match. You tend to miss messages sent by matches even when you're in the app because notifications simply don't happen. Also if you use the app for to much in one sitting it starts to lag horribly.", "Well, for starters, Tinder is quite a good app when it comes to dating. I've met decent people from both genders to make friends with and dated a couple ladies who... let's just say we were not meant to be together, hence it was on our end. Now, my problem with the app lies in 2 major updates. First, if the devs would apply the photo verification feature, it would help eliminate fake profiles. Secondly, having to notify users where texts has been read would solve a lot of question marks. Thanks!"], 'appId': 'com.tinder', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinder&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us'}
